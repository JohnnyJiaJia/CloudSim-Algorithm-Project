# Priority Based Task Scheduling Algorithm for Cloud Computing

## Description:
This project aims to provide a proof-of-concept for a priority-based task scheduling algorithm, that considers the waiting time of tasks (preventing task starvation) and escalates tasks accordingly. Waiting time is considered using a weighting factor in an equation that determines a priority value for each task. This equation also takes a user set priority value between 1 and 10 as input.
